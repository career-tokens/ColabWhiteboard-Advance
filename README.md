# ColabWhiteboard-Advance
It is mainly a multiplayer collaborative Whiteboard where you and your friends can join a secure room and draw, teach and learn in realtime.
You can also download the image.
This is a full stack application where the frontend is built using NextJS , TailwindCSS , Material UI and other technologies.Sockets will be 
common to both frontend and backend.
For backend , we use NodeJS , ExpressJS and MongoDB.
We used a separate backend instead of NextJS's in built feature coz backend's socket server cant be deployed on Vercel.
It will also work on mobile phones !

# Deployed Link:

Please be patient while logging in.The server at the first go will take around 5 mins to wake up and respond.You can either create a new user or you can also
log in using name:Don and email:don@gmail.com

# Totally responsive and beautiful UI alongwith Authentication
